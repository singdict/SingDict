This system aims to provide a more comprehensive and collective representation of constituents' interests.\n\nKey Takeaway:\nGroup Representation Constituency (GRC) is a unique electoral system in Singapore that ensures minority representation in Parliament by requiring political parties to field a team of candidates from diverse racial or ethnic backgrounds. This system fosters cooperation, multicultural dialogue, and enhances collective representation."}
