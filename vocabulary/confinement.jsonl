{"Word": "confinement", "POS": "N", "Pronunciation": "", "Definition": "A period of postnatal care that new mothers in Singapore undergo, typically lasting around 30 to 40 days. During confinement, the mother is advised to observe rest, physical restrictions, and a diet of specific foods such as red dates and ginger, while also taking care of her newborn baby. This tradition, thought to improve a mother's long-term health, is still commonly practiced in Singapore. Note: The word 'confinement' in Singlish carries a very specific meaning related to postnatal care, and is not used in other contexts in the same way it might be in Standard English.", "Example": "", "Origin": "English"}
