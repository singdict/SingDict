{"Word": "belacan", "Pronunciation": "b @ . l A . tS A n\nb l A . tS A n", "Definition": "Belacan is a type of fermented shrimp paste commonly used in Southeast Asian cuisine, particularly in Malaysian and Indonesian dishes. It is made from grinding up small shrimp and then fermenting them with salt for several weeks, until the mixture becomes a thick paste with a very strong, pungent aroma. Belacan is a staple ingredient in dishes like sambal belacan (a spicy chili paste), asam pedas (a sour and spicy fish stew), and kangkung belacan (water spinach stir-fried with belacan and chili). A little bit goes a long way in terms of adding umami and depth to dishes, but it's definitely not for the faint of heart!", "Example": "1. Be careful not to inhale too deeply when using belacan in the kitchen - the smell can be quite overpowering!", "Origin": "Malay"}
