# SingDict
SingDict is a dictionary of Singlish terms built upon definitions as generated by ChatGPT.

## Data
Raw data used for our dictionary is stored in the `data/dictionary` directory with the subdirectory names as the source of the vocabulary.

* `0_words.txt` contains the words extracted from the respective sources
* `1_descriptions.jsonl` contains ChatGPT's responses for the entries of those words

The `vocabulary` directory contains the human evaluated versions of the dictionary entries taken from an excel sheet which contains our work in progress. This directory is updated in batches according to when the script is run.

## Scripts
The `scripts` directory contains the scripts to extract the words from the websites and to extract the evaluated entries from google sheets.
