It refers to a geographically defined electoral division in which a group of candidates run collectively as a team, rather than individually, in general elections. Each GRC has a predetermined number of seats to be contested and requires the representation of candidates from different ethnic backgrounds, aiming for multiracial representation in Parliament.\n\nUsage:\n- In the upcoming elections, several Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) will be fiercely contested.\n- The Group Representation Constituency system ensures that diverse voices are represented in Singapore's Parliament.\n\nExplanation:\nThe concept of Group Representation Constituencies was introduced in Singapore in 1988 with the objective of ensuring minority representation in Parliament and promoting racial harmony. Under the GRC system, political parties are required to form a team of candidates that includes members from different racial or ethnic backgrounds. The number of candidates in each GRC team can vary, usually ranging from three to six, depending on the constituency's size.\n\nThis unique electoral framework ensures balanced representation and prevents a concentration of power in any single ethnic group. By requiring candidates from diverse backgrounds to run as a team, the GRC system encourages cooperation and fosters multicultural dialogue within political parties.\n\nIn addition to promoting multiculturalism, the GRC system also enhances representation by allowing voters to choose their preferred political party or team rather than selecting individual candidates. This system aims to provide a more comprehensive and collective representation of constituents' interests.\n\nKey Takeaway:\nGroup Representation Constituency (GRC) is a unique electoral system in Singapore that ensures minority representation in Parliament by requiring political parties to field a team of candidates from diverse racial or ethnic backgrounds. This system fosters cooperation, multicultural dialogue, and enhances collective representation.",,,,,,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,Wiktionary,
